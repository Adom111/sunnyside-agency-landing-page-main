## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
/* Adding Fonts */
@font-face {
    font-family: 'Barlow';
    src: url('fonts/Barlow-Regular.ttf');
}

h1,h2 {
  font-family: 'Barlow';
}

/* Variables */
--Soft_red: hsl(7, 99%, 70%);

h1 {
  color: ver(--Soft_red: hsl(7, 99%, 70%););
}

/* Desktop style */

@media only screen and (min-width:376px) {
}
```


### Continued development

- Layout
- Grids
- Flex


### Useful resources
